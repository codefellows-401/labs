# 04: Buffers - Bitmap Transformer
## Overview
For this assignment you will be building a bitmap (.bmp) transformer CLI. It will read a bitmap in from disk, run one or more color or raster transforms and then write it out to a new file. This project will require the use of node buffers in order to manipulate binary data. Your solution should be composed of small tested modules that solve specific problems. Your modules should be thoughfuly named and well documented. The entry point to your CLI should be an index.js file in the root of your package, and all helper modules should be placed in your lib/ directory. Your bitmap transformer modules should not use any third party libraries.

- **Assignment 1:** Do this with callbacks
- **Assignment 2:** Modularize the code
- **Stretch Goal:** Refactor to use promises

Also consider the following: 
- What should be unique, testable modules? 
- What structure should you use to most easily export? 
- How best can we make this scale?

## Tools & Dependencies
